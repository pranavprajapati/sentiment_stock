# Global Sentiments affecting Stock Prices

Understanding the stock market has been for a long time an active area of research. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that stocks are largely driven by new information and follow a random walk pattern.
Based on the premise that emotions and moods of individuals affect decision making, we will be studying the correlation between “public sentiment” and stock's movement.

By applying sentimental analysis and machine learning algorithms we would be able to find an approximate correlation between “public sentiment” and stock price movement. Most of the correlation summary is based on visualizations made and not mathematical calculations.
